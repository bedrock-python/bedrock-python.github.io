# UUIDv7 as a PostgreSQL partition key

- **Post:** `docs/blog/posts/2026-09-07-uuidv7-as-a-postgresql-partition-key.md`
- **Category:** Design
- **Idea:** A time-ordered id is the time axis, so the key you already have is the partition key.

## Prompt

```text
Flat vector editorial illustration in the Bedrock Python house style. Isometric geometry built from clean straight-edged polygons and simple extruded blocks, drawn as if from the same construction as the brand mark: an isometric cube cut into flat facets separated by thin white negative-space gaps. Solid flat fills only -- no gradients, no glow, no drop shadows, no texture, no photorealistic 3D rendering. Every facet is one uniform colour: no shading, blending or vignette inside a face, tone changes only at an edge. Palette: warm off-white background #F8F6F1; forms in graphite and slate blue #1F2933, #263642, #405463, #667989, #9AAABA; exactly one accent colour, terracotta #C9572C, used sparingly and only on the single element the picture is about -- #C9572C exactly on its lit face and a darker shade of the same terracotta on its shaded faces, never a lighter orange. Small forms take their fills from the slate list and are never white or near-white: nothing in the picture may match the background. Generous negative space, calm and precise, the restraint of an engineering diagram rather than decoration. Centred composition with wide margins, 16:10 landscape.

Objects from this series' shared vocabulary appear here and must be drawn exactly as described:
- partition slabs: narrow upright table slabs of equal width standing in a row beneath one long parent bar, each ruled with the same rows

Subject: One long key bar whose leading section is divided into fine even segments, and that section lines up exactly with the boundaries of the partition slabs standing beneath it: the segment edges and the slab edges are the same vertical lines. The trailing section of the key is one undivided form. The boundary line running from key down to slab is terracotta.

No text, no letters, no numbers, no labels, no captions, no code, no UI screenshots, no logos, no brand names, no arrows with words. No people, no faces, no hands. No robots, gears, circuit boards, server racks with blinking lights, cloud shapes or other stock technology cliches. No neon, no dark background, no glossy spheres, no light orbs, no bokeh, no lens flare, no sparkles. No soft shading or gradient across a single face, and no white or near-white fill on any object.
